### Why are we here

On planet
Discover abandoned
Find Zentra tubes
Follow tubes and discover history

### What you discover

Alien race has distributed consciousness
Cephalapod god
Octo based conting system
Once a cycle they must Zentra - A process of nourishment where they must flush their bodily fluid, called Zentra, with fresh zentra. It is a silvery thick liquid
They have Zentra pipes branching throughout the city
In the game you move in to the city attempting to discover the source of the zentra pipes. As you get closer the pipes get bigger. This is a central narrative line that allows us branching and reconnect to path
Sometimes it's not clear which pipe is the central one
Character movement goes towards the source of the zentra flow
The society believes that the more one can separate the more wisdom one has
As you gain more 'wisdom' through a greater profinity to splitting your social status gets elevated and your duties hold more responsibility
Sometimes when you enter a space the abandoned city attempts to 'turn on' the room. Reactivating the lights and the flow of Zentra. This acts as a traceable element, marking the progression for the player.
Could you build the cities inspired by a real cities pipe maps

Level idea - Flooding room of Zentra.

### Architecture

Half floors - So that the feet can see what the head is doing
Octogon Plaats
As you progress the architecture changes. You start in slums or regular housing, and you move towards more protected areas through caves and deeper towards the source of the Zentra.
The natural landscape is cavey - lots of caves
Low poly flat textures strechted on surfaces (ala n64 era 3d)
Realism and detail could be carried by fluid simulations.
We can use this liquid as a game mechanic.
Zentra chapels along the main pipes, good opportunity for side quests or saving etc.

### Animals and creatures

The animals have survived and flourished. Robots are the only semi intellgent beings left.

#### Pilqam

Herd animal. A large tadpole shaped creature with millipede legs and antenna. It's slimy and amphibian. During the day it grazes in the water.

#### Geller

A dangerous if not controlled, but easily manipulated creature. Throughout the game you find this animal in different levels of domestication. Left to it's own devices it can get quite large and savage. Think iguana/komodo dragon crossed with a fox. A carnivore

#### Haruk

A flying reptilian that prefers cavern spaces. With the wingspan about the length of a human torso. It is a scavenger and will feed on pretty much anything.

#### Robots

Used to replace laborious tasks. One such is rounding up Pilqam into their pens at night.

### Scenario

You walk through a door down a narrow corridor. You enter a what seems to be a foyer. There is a stairset, but at the bottom of the stairset there is a locked door. It draws you to go through it. So you go back up the stairs into the foyer and you see there are three other sized doors besides the door at the courtyard that you etnered through. The only issue that the doors are peculiarly small.

Coming closer to the one on your left you notice that it is made to fit only a round head sized object. You send your head in to explore. Inside the most noticeable thing is there is a corrugated grill on the floor. In which you peer and can see a factory below. It is sealed off so you cannot get there. Looking around you see that there is a platform above you, that seems to lead deep into the walls of the room. You roll on under it to the far wall, and through a window you notice a lever in a small control room. There's no direct access to that room from where you are, but you figure there must be a way to get to it.

At this point you return to the central room and connect to your body. You now have a resolve to find the control room, and try that lever

### Targets

At the moment we use a proxy of 'levers' for our goal elements in the games. We image these could be replaced with any kind of interactable system such as buttons, flow control, small puzzles, locks etc. This is a simplification as we sort out the more important elements of the concept. In the level we describe in the map, we image that pulling down the three levers would be the way to unlock the next door.

### Windows

We use windows in the map to help hint and guide the curiousity of our players into exploring new areas. We use half level architecture so that through a window you can often see a floor lower and a floor higher at the same time. Giving you a sense of vertical orientation.

### Flow charts
To help us design our rooms we did an exercise where one person would act as the evironment and the other as the character (arm, leg, head). Where the environment would create a  goal and the character would think of a response that would guide them closer to the goal. This was done iteratively and the outcome captured in the flowcharts below. Note that at this stage we did not have a unifying concept universe so the elements mentioned are generic (ie: the farmer from the 'arm' flowchart becomes a robot in the context of our game world).

![Leg Flowchart](./leg-flowchart.png)
![Head Flowchart](./head-flowchart.png)

Before we were thinking about our game world we thought it could be a useful exercise to abstract the key elements from the flow charts without naming concrete objects. This turned out to be difficult and easier to think on a case by case basis. Nevertheless we captured one of these exercises in the flowchart below.
