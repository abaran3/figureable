This week we returned to the [first game concept](https://figureable.netlify.com/day-1-game-1) that we had put together on day 1. The game - or maybe 'exercise' would be a more fitting way to describe it - was fun at the time, but barely replicable in a consistent way. Keeping track of the limbs and joints that we were choosing to rotate and lock was complex to the extent that it became hard to pay attention to the emergent movement of the limb-bodies. We had concluded the session agreeing that the game might be better enjoyed as a computer simulation.

We find it relevant to engage with modes of movement for the development of our game concept, so we found this messy rotation game worth revisiting nevertheless. For a revised version, we wanted to make the exercise more playable. To focus the game on the part we found most interesting - the movement of a body emergent from rotations of sets of limbs around different joints - we decided to cut down some of the choices that we had originally thought of leaving to the player.
